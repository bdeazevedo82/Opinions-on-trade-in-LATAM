# LATINOBAROMETRO

Latinobarometro is a survey that has been conducted on a periodical basis since 1995. The objetive is to find out Latin Americans opinions on a broad range of subjects, from 
democratic values to economic and trade issues.

For my analysis I used the latest data, from the 2018 survey, which surveyed 20,204 people from 18 countries in the Latin American region. 

All data is publicly available and can be found here in different formats:
